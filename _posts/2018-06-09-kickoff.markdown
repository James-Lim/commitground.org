We had a kick off meeting last Wednessday(6/6). Jin, Chet(Junghoon) and James(Wanseob) got together through 'hangout' and reviewed the the first draft of commitground whitepaper in Korean version.

A new journey has started! We're sure that commitground will be the future culture of software development.
